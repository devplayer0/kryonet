This project is based on Nathan Sweet's [KryoNet](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet)
This specific fork is compatible with Java 7.

This project is not backwards-compatible with KryoNet, but the following guide expects you to be familiar with it. This project aims to provides higher abstraction over KryoNet with stronger type safety and potentially better performance by reducing redundant serialization of messages.


Key changes from KryoNet
- connection.sendToAll(msg) serializes msg exactly once, rather than once per connection
- Support for caching pre-serialized forms of commonly used messages (see CachedMessage<T>)
- Adds support for 'queries' -- Messages that expect a reply.
- Supports registering callbacks for message types. O(1) dispatch without use of instanceof
- Uses Jackson for json serialization rather than jsonbeans.
- Requires all message types to implement MessageToServer or MessageToClient
- Uses ConcurrentUnit for unit tests which catch many failures that are ignored in KryoNet
- Removes support for RMI


Tips:
- Messages should be sent with connection.send() which delegates to sendTCP or sendUDP depending on the message type
- Don't rely on instanceOf checks, use RegisteredServerListener and RegisteredClientListener to register callbacks for each message type.

## Creating a Server and Client
Getting started is identical to kryonet if you intend to use the default server/client
```java
	Server server = new Server();
	server.start();
	server.bind(tcpPort, udpPort);

	Client client = new Client();
	client.start();
	client.connect(timeOut, "localhost", tcpPort, udpPort);
```



## Defining a message type;
- Messages should implement either MessageToServer, MessageToClient, or both.
- All messages inherit an isReliable method that indicates whether they should be sent over TCP or UDP by default. The intent is that you first design your game using TCP for everything, and then optimize later by selecting messages types that can be send over UDP by just overriding this method.

```java
	/** This message indicates that the client has requested their player to move once in a particular direction.
	* This message is send over TCP by default when using server.send(MessageToSever).
	* If UDP is desired in specific instances, you can still use sever.sendUDP(MessageToServer)*/
    public class MovementMessage implements MessageToSever {

    	public Direction dir;

    	MovementMessage() {
    		// Used by Kryo deserializer
    	}

    	public MovementMessage(Direction d){
    		dir = d;
    	}
    }
```

To define a message type that defaults to UDP:

```java
	/** This message updates the client's knowledge of the player's position. Since this message is sent
	* frequently and the info is quickly outdated, we will send this over UDP by default.
	* the method player.getConnection().sendTCP(MessageToClient) will override this behavior though.
	*/
    public class PositionUpdateMessage implements MessageToClient {

    	public int x, y;

    	PositionUpdateMessage() {
    		// Used by Kryo deserializer
    	}

    	public PositionUpdateMessage(int xx , int yy){
    		x = xx;
    		y = yy;
    	}

    	@Override
    	public boolean isReliable(){
    		return false; // False indicates that messages of this type should be sent over UDP
    	}
    }
```


##Registering Callbacks
RegisteredListeners support mapping Message types to callbacks that can be invoked in constant time.
Here's an example that demonstrates adding callbacks for messages and queries.
```java
	RegisteredServerListener listener = new RegisteredServerListener();

	// Delegate to appropriate handler
	listener.addHandler(MovementMessage.class, (msg, sender) -> movementHandler.handle(msg, sender));

	listener.addQueryHandle(LoginQuery.class, (query, connection) -> {
		//Reply should be called once on each query to send back a result
        if(query.username.equals("John Smith") && query.password.equals("1234")) {
        	query.reply(LoginStatus.SUCCESS);
        } else {
		query.reply(LoginStatus.FAILURE);            
        }
    });

    server.addListener(listener);
```



##Queries
Queries are types of messages that are intended to invoke a reply from the other endpoint. Queries and their results are always sent over TCP. You can define a query that returns a type T by extending QueryToServer<T> or QueryToClient<T>


Let's say that you're developing a turn-based strategy game.
In your game client, you probably have code that involves logging into your game server, since every request of this type will require a response, it may be appropriate to create a LoginQuery class that extends QueryToServer<T>.

Doing so produces code that is really easy to reason about. Additionally, there is no need for a dependency between your packet listener and your login logic
```java
    public void attemptLogin(String username, String password) {
	    LoginStatus response = server.sendAndWait(new LoginQuery(username, password)); // This call blocks until server responds.
	    if(response == LoginStatus.SUCCESS) {
	    	loadGame();
	    } else {
	    	showDialog("Username/Password combination is incorrect.")
	    }
    }
```


Queries can also be handled asynchronously with callbacks. Let's say our player is in the middle of a battle and the server needs to indicate to the client that it's time to select an option.
```java
    player.sendAsync(new RequestSelection(), new Consumer<Selection>(){
    	@Override
    	public void accept(Selection reply){
    	   // Handle selection. This code will run in another thread.
    	}
    });

```

Queries are defined very much like normal messages. For example, we can define RequestSelection very simply as
```java
	public class RequestSelection extends QueryToClient<Selection> { }
```


##Pre-serialized Messages
Identical messages that are sent frequently can be serialized once ahead-of-time and sent more efficiently later. A quick benchmark suggests that pre-serialized messages can be sent 10x faster for simple objects. The CachedMessage object creates a ByteBuffer of minimal size to hold the serialized form (With kryo serialization this is a very small memory cost, but could be significant with json or other formats). Creation of CachedMessages is relatively expensive and should be done before the server starts. For messages with dynamic content that can't be cached at start-up, use the variants of server.sendToAll(MessageToClient, Iterable<ClientConnection>), which will only perform serialization once for a batch send.

```java
	CachedMessageFactory msgFactory = server.getCachedMessageFactory();
	MyMessage msg = new MyMessage(); 	// Message that will be cached.
	CachedMessage<MyMessage> cached = msgFactory.create(msg);
	connection.send(cached);  	// Equivalent of connection.send(msg), but faster.
```
